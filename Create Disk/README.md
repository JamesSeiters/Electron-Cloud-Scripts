create-disk is now obsolete. create-diskv2 is in beta and works but has not been fully tested or reviewed. The script correctly creates the ZVOLS, VMDK files, and the proper entry in the udev rules file. I have not tested creating more then one drive or with existing drives. There are many "weird" scenarios that some to mind there.
